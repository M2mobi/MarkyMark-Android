/**
 * Represents a Markdown headline (heading). Mapped from [Heading][com.vladsch.flexmark.ast.Heading].
 *
 * Headings are used to create section titles and establish document structure. They are rendered
 * with larger and/or bolder text, with size decreasing as heading level increases (Heading1 is
 * largest, Heading6 is smallest).
 *
 * __Basic Syntax:__
 *
 * Headings are created using hash characters (#) at the start of the line. The number of hash
 * characters determines the heading level (1-6):
 *
 * ```markdown
 * # Heading 1
 * ## Heading 2
 * ### Heading 3
 * #### Heading 4
 * ##### Heading 5
 * ###### Heading 6
 * ```
 *
 * __Alternative Syntax:__
 *
 * For level 1 and 2 headings only, an alternative "underline" syntax is also supported:
 *
 * ```markdown
 * Heading 1
 * =========
 *
 * Heading 2
 * ---------
 * ```
 *
 * __Best Practices:__
 *
 * - Always put a space between the # symbols and the heading text
 * - For better compatibility, add blank lines before and after headings
 * - Use heading levels in order (don't skip levels) for proper document structure
 * - Avoid using more than 6 # symbols as they won't be recognized as headings
 *
 * __Formatting in Headings:__
 *
 * Headings can contain inline formatting such as emphasis (bold/italic), links, and code:
 *
 * ```markdown
 * ## **Bold** Heading with [Link](https://example.com) and `code`
 * ```
 *
 * For more details, see the [Markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax#headings).
 *
 * @property metadata Contains information about this heading node, including its position in the
 *   document hierarchy and any additional metadata.
 * @property children The list of child nodes contained within this heading, typically inline
 *   elements like text, emphasis, links, etc. These represent the content of the heading.
 * @property headingLevel The level of the heading (1-6), represented by the [Level] enum.
 *   This determines how the heading is styled and its hierarchical importance in the document.
